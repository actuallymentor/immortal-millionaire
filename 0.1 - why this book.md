# Why this book

I have spent years reading books, watching documentaries and listening to those smarter and more experienced than myself. I found that the things I wanted to know were already out there in books or web pages. For me, the issue was that everything was fragmented and overly complicated.

This book attempts to structure and distil the things I found for effective consumption. I realise that some people will not like this book because it is more like a handbook than a story and I'm ok with that. This is the book I wish I could have read years ago and hopefully it will save some people a number of years of research.

A few of the tangible benefits that I achieved based on this information are:

- Productivity levels that scare some people
- Ability to re-program my habits with minimal effort
- A strong and flexible body with less effort than I thought possible
- A diet that optimised for cognitive performance and long life
- A clear roadmap of how I plan to retire before age 40
- Automated budget and investment systems that cause me zero stress

## Good to know

This book was written over the course of a year, during which my friends, family and blog readers volunteered to check up on my progress weekly and shame me publicly on social media if I didn't keep my promise of making 7 updates per week.

**My misgivings**

While this work has been proofread, I'm a stubborn person. You are likely to notice that I mix US and UK spellings of words, use commas more than I should and have a disdain for the Oxford comma (see what I did there?). If these things hurt your eyes I apologise and suggest you spend some time with the [Eyebleach](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/) community to make you feel better.

**Acknowledgements**

There are many people who contributed to the creation of this book. Some of them are close to me and some I have never even met. Special thanks to those who kept me motivated by checking up on my work every Monday for almost a year, particularly those who commented with suggestions and words of encouragement: Mart√≠n, Sue, Tom, Lionel, Elaine, Andrew, JJ, Magalie, Rituparna and Mikel. Extra gratitude points to Fran, Liesbeth, Tom and Sasha who proofread the draft at multiple stages.

**This book is open source**

I want to share these things with as many people as I can. The benefits I have received are beyond amazing and I wish them upon everyone.

Additionally, one of my major annoyances with buying eBooks is that when I want to quickly refer back to a specific passage I can't do this quickly online because (legal) online copies of books are rare.

This is why a copy of this book is published under an open source license. This means that while you can buy the book, there is a free reference copy available on [Github](https://actuallymentor.github.io/immortal-millionaire/).

The online copy is released under the [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license. This means you can view the online reference version for free in a less user-friendly format than the eBook version for sale. You may also share this free version so long as you don't charge money for it.

Have fun and keep growing.
