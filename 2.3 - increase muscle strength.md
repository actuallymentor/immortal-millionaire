# Increase muscle strength

![Man Working Out]( ./assets/2.3.jpg )

Physical strength breeds a sense of mental strength, a feeling of being able to impact the world. Movements that were once difficult become trivial, there is a sense of effortlessness that is hard to describe.

**Principles for strength development**

1. Do high load exercises in low repetitions
2. Do not do exercises to muscle failure
2. Do many repetitions spaced out over the day (or in a gym, take breaks between sets)

## Do high load exercises in low repetitions

Strength is greatly neurological, the strength of a muscle depends not only on its size but also on how well you are able to activate it. Electrocution or tetanus, for example, can cause the muscles to spasm violent enough to break bones. Training for strength is decidedly different than training for muscle size gain.

While muscle size is one factor, it is not the only variable in muscle strength. The physical structure of the muscle determines theoretical output, just like how many seconds it takes for a car to accelerate to a certain speed if you give it full throttle. The neurological element is how well you are able to 'press the throttle' of your muscles.

What matters in practice is the neurological signal to exert force. There is a safety limit on the percentage of strength a muscle can theoretically and practically produce, which makes sense since we don't want to accidentally break our bones using our own muscle force like in the above tetanus example. When comparing bodybuilders (big muscles) to weightlifters (strong muscles) you will observe that weightlifters can lift far heavier weights than bodybuilders their size.

When training for strength you are in essence helping your body understand how much strength is safe to use.

## Do not exercise to muscle failure

A popular approach to strength rather than muscle size is *Greasing the Groove* as described by Pavel Tsatsouline. This protocol consists of three tenets:

1. High load (lots of effort)
2. Low consecutive repetitions (no exhaustion)
3. Regular repetitions throughout the day

The **high load** refers to the need to use muscles close to their strength limit. It's not about exhausting them but rather about making one repetition of a difficult move.

The **low repetition** element is linked to the above. If you can do 10 repetitions of a movement, it is not hard enough for this protocol. Heavier exercises with lower repetitions are better under the condition you can execute them with good technique.

The **regular repetitions** refer to doing the high-load movements often throughout the day. Where muscle growth asks you to do a larger volume of heavy movements after each other, this protocol wants you to do single repetition sessions every hour or even half an hour.

The protocol as written by Pavel focuses on two body-weight exercises:

- One-handed (and/or simultaneously one-legged) push-up
- Pistol squat

![One handed push-up with one leg](./assets/commissioned/ohp-one-leg.svg)

![Pistol squats](./assets/commissioned/pistol-squat.svg)

These are highly technical moves that stimulate a large number of muscle groups. The one-handed/legged push-up, for example, stimulates everything from triceps to pectorals to the core and even the upper leg.

The principles of this protocol, however, translate to many other exercises. Just keep in mind that this protocol is more dangerous with respect to injuries since you are training with high muscle-load. Technique is even more important than with regular resistance training.

**Suggested exercises**

The below two progressions are a suggestion on how to work your way up to one-handed and legged push-ups as well as the pistol squat. Start with the first one, and as you get stronger, build your way to the next exercise. Proper form is the bottleneck. If you can't do a movement with good form, don't go to the next one yet.

Progression one:

- Push-up
- One-handed push-up, downward motion only
- One-handed push-up
- One handed and one-legged push-up

Progression two:

- Squat
- Pistol squat, downward motion only
- Full pistol squat

If a pull-up bar is available, pull-ups are great.

You may modulate the difficulty of any exercise by doing it slower. A 5-second push-up is harder than a quick one for example. Some studies indicate that focussing on eccentric movement (downward in this case) is best for strength development.

## Motivation and consistency

As with losing weight, things like accountability are very important. But while weight loss is an all-day endeavour, exercise is often more about routine and consistency.

For hypertrophy (muscle size) training it is advisable to have certain days or times of day where you exercise. Personally, I like going to the gym (and consecutively sauna) in the morning. Whatever works for you, schedule it. Put it on your calendar. Preferably have a friend or personal trainer to hold you accountable.

## Getting started

Any structural changes to your body take structural behaviour changes. In the case of increasing your strength, that means consistently practising the 'skill' of strength. Before you emphasise what specific exercises you will use for your strength development, consider how you want to implement consistent habits.

Strength development depends on technically well-executed motions under high load and low repetitions. For most people that means either:

- Going to the gym and practising the big 3 (squat, deadlift, bench press) with high weight, low repetitions and long breaks between sets
- Practising intense callisthenics (one-handed push-up, pistol squat) spaced out throughout the day

What form this takes for you personally depends on how you live your life. If you spend your working days wearing a suit and tie, dropping for a push-up every hour might not be feasible whereas using the company gym at lunch could work great. If you work in a more casual workplace it may be totally feasible to do exercises at your workplace.

Start by instituting one habit and build from there. Even if that means you go to the gym and do 1 technically perfect repetition (after a warm-up of course), or you do a single push-up at lunch. Build the habit, and then increase the intensity and volume of your practice.

The most important element is consistency. You need to give your body the signal to get stronger (heavy exercises) and then give it time to adapt. Approaches I have personally found to work are:

- Going to the gym before work
- Do exercises next to my desk (some funny comments in week 1, week 2 nobody even notices, some even join)
- Lobby for a pull-up bar in the doorframe of the bathroom
- Do push-ups in the bathroom when you go. Do it right before washing your hands so your hands will be clean after

Find whatever helps you practice more regularly. I personally noticed I feel far less resistance to doing exercises if there is an easy to use space where not many people see me. Likewise, my morning exercises are easier to adhere to in the presence of a high-quality fitness mat.

## Stan Lee's Superhumans

It took me a while to realise that muscle size and strength are not proportional per se. People like Pavel Tsatsouline said it many times. What really drove it home for me was a Discovery Channel episode of Stan Lee's Superhumans (excelsior Stan).

This particular episode covered a man called Dennis Rogers, a reasonably unassuming looking guy who proceeded to bend pans, wrenches and other miscellaneous items with his bare hands.

Of course, the TV show made a big show out of calling him the strongest man in the world, but I just couldn't deny that this man's strength to size ratio turned all the broscience spoken around the gym on its head.

From that moment on I took the whole strength versus size thesis more seriously. The common theme in recommendations on strength training I would include:

- Eccentric motion is more important
- Muscle exhaustion is undesirable

Eccentric refers to the negative part of an exercise, the part where the muscle stretches. For example, the downward part of a squat.

I started experimenting with all sorts of exercises, mostly in the gym. After listening to a podcast featuring Pavel Tsatsouline, I obtained some of his books. In particular, one called The Naked Warrior.

This book caught my eye because it focussed on bodyweight training only. The appeal of that approach to me is that I can keep practising when travelling or am otherwise unable to go to a gym.

The book focussed on only 2 exercises:

- Pistol squat
- Push up on one hand & one leg

The book also stressed the 'Greasing the Groove' approach, which sees strength as a skill. Under the motto of practice makes perfect, the book recommends:

- Doing intense exercises
- Never training to failure

The first translates to practising the skill of strength by tackling an exercise you find difficult. The second means you do not push your body to the point where you can't do any more exercises after.

In practice, the recommendations came down to doing pistol squats and one hand/leg push-ups throughout the day, getting your total count up as high as you can without ever exhausting your muscles.

The result of this is a signal to your nervous system that you are trying to use your muscles for more strength without triggering the muscle exhaustion response that is most effective for muscle gain. The result is more strength without all that much muscle gain.

The journey to reaching the point where I am now took a while. For the one-handed push-ups, it took me a while to build my way up. In the beginning, it took all my willpower to only do a downward motion one-handed push-up, but as I kept doing them throughout the day my strength levels increased reliably.

The nice and yet odd element of this approach is that you will be doing push-ups in the strangest places. I made it a routine to do some one-handed push-ups in the bathroom before I washed my hands, for example.

The pistol squat was even harder for me. Not just because it takes a lot of strength, but also because it requires balance and flexibility. For me specifically, the Achilles and calf were so tight that I would fall backwards whenever I attempted a pistol squat. I worked my way up by:

- Stretching the Achilles
- Holding some weight in my hands for balance
- Holding chairs/tables/etc for balance

By now, a pistol squat is no problem whatsoever, but it did take some time to get there.

I've also realised that a little warm-up is needed for these kinds of intense exercises. Nothing extreme, but if you are going to do a one-handed push-up at least warm up your hip and shoulder joints a bit.

My current exercise routine heavily depends on daily pistol squats and one-handed & legged push-ups. They are great portable exercises that activate a large set of muscles. Combined with a stretching routine (see stretching chapter) it takes care of daily physical fitness very effectively.
