# Learn faster

![Light Bulb]( ./assets/1.3.jpg )

Learning is about understanding patterns and connections. Sure you could memorise a sequence like 2-3-5-8-13-21, or you could see that it is the Fibonacci sequence and be able to write down the next hundred or more numbers of the sequence. Learning is the skill of seeing how everything is connected and what you can do with those insights.

**Principles for faster learning**

## Start with a growth mindset

Our society has a tendency to glorify talent and genius. We say we value hard work, but as soon as someone excels we call them 'talented', thereby most rudely negating their work at developing their skill. There are two ways you can look at your ability:

- A fixed mindset (I am talented)
- A growth mindset (I am skilled)

The first is a destructive mindset, the second will empower you to grow. Don't get me wrong, genetics is real. There are people who are born with an affinity for certain types of thinking or specific physical attributes. But for every 'talented' sports player there are crowds of people with similar genetics who are overweight, and for every genius mathematician there is a taxi driver who never learned to read algebra.

Look at it this way, if you are going to cook, which equipment would win:

- A small pocket knife
- A set of sharpened chef's knives

But even with the chef's knives, do you think you could beat a well-trained Michelin star chef with a pocket knife? Would your unfair advantage beat the years of hard work this person put into their training?

From [Even Geniuses Work Hard](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/sept10/vol68/num01/Even-Geniuses-Work-Hard.aspx), Carol Dweck[^She's at the time of writing a Stanford professor, though she taught at Harvard, Columbia and Illinois as well. See her [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck)]:

**A fixed mindset is limiting to your potential**

> Students with a fixed mindset do not like effort. They believe that if you have ability, everything should come naturally. They tell us that when they have to work hard, they feel dumb. ... students with a fixed mindset tend not to handle setbacks well. Because they believe that setbacks call their intelligence into question

**Contrasting to those with a growth mindset**

> Students with a growth mindset, on the other hand, view challenging work as an opportunity to learn and grow. ... Students with a growth mindset are more likely to respond to initial obstacles by remaining involved, trying new strategies, and using all the resources at their disposal for learning

Be vigilant to your self-talk and train yourself to change from fixed mind statements to growth mindset perspectives. "I'm not good at math" becomes "I've not had a lot of math training". "I'm a talented football player" becomes "I've trained to be a good football player" and so on. 

## Think in systems rather than facts

Imagine I show you a large pile of bricks and tell you to memorise the location of all the bricks. You then close your eyes and I take one away. Are you confident you can tell me which brick is missing?

Now imagine that we take those bricks and build a little house out of them. If I remove a brick now, it would be trivial to find out which. In fact, you could not only see which brick is missing, but you could make a very accurate guess at what kind of brick should fill up the empty spot.

Learning should work the same. Instead of jumbled facts brute forced into your mind, build trees and networks of knowledge. It is common to find this kind of reasoning in the sciences and engineering, but it can be applied everywhere.

Let's say we are baking a cake. The ingredient list says:

- 200 grams of butter
- 200 grams of sugar
- 200 grams of flour
- 4 eggs

It turns out we only have 3 eggs in the house! A fact thinker might come to the conclusion we can't make the cake or have to choose a different recipe. A systems thinker, on the other hand, will say that a recipe is about ratios. Meaning we can create a smaller cake according to the recipe by subtracting 25% from the butter, sugar and flour. One less egg is 1/4 less, which is 25%.

Cooking is a very simple example, but this concept becomes incredibly powerful as you apply it more. It will also allow you to make connections across what are usually considered isolated areas of knowledge.

For example:

- **Ideas and religions compete for humans the same way viruses compete for hosts:** A _biological virus_ is a piece of information stored in DNA. This virus enters the human and uses the human body to multiply and spread to other humans. Some humans are well-defended against some viruses, others are not. _Ideas_ are pieces of information stored as thoughts. They are transferred from human to human through speech, text and other media. Depending on how powerful an idea is (how contagious) it easily infects people. Like with viruses some people are resistant to ideas and others are very receptive. Like a virus, an idea can spread through a community of people and benefit or harm it. 
- **The internet works similar to the human nervous system:** Both transfer information through electrical charges. Both consist out of a number of nodes that through their connection to other nodes communicate. And indeed both systems lose their function if you cut important connections.
- **Blood vessels follow a pattern similar to tree branches:** Both optimise surface areas. Tree branches form in a way that tries to optimise the amount of sun its leaves get. You could say that a tree pushes branches away from each other to prevent leaves from growing in the other's shade. Likewise, blood vessels optimise surface area to spread oxygen and carbon dioxide. Like leaves, the vessels spread away from each other so they don't needlessly compete.

The more you connect things, the easier it becomes to understand new things.

## Richard Feynman technique

Feynman was a physicist who was known for being able to explain nearly everything to nearly everyone. He exemplifies the concept that nothing is too difficult to understand. All it takes is the right understanding. The Feynman technique goes like this:

1. Explain a concept to a kid (real/imaginary)
2. Note down your gaps in knowledge
3. Research
4. Repeat

Many times people who think something is too hard to explain to a novice simply do not understand the concept well enough to break it down. Instead, they talk in circles and make things harder than they need to be. If you doubt this, look at [Feynman explaining the chemistry and physics of fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pIYI5JQLE) or if you like math check out this explanation of why [(a+b)²=a²+2ab+b²](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49_TJymgXgM). Want something more recent? Take 2:41 minutes to learn [how DNA is turned into proteins in your body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA).

I personally have had great learning success explaining materials to a rubber duck. The key to this technique is that explaining a concept to someone (or something) who doesn't understand the concept (yet) forces you to break it down to its core. If you explain the thing you are trying to learn to a fellow student, for example, you are likely to skip explaining steps that you both understand. This leads you to not breaking down the structure of the subject all the way to its core, which inhibits you fully understanding it.

Let's for example, say you are studying gravity. If you tell a kid that gravity is a force that pulls things together, you might get back all sorts of questions:

- Why do two apples not stick together?
- Why does a feather fall slower than a rock?
- Why does gravity exist?

You then turn to books, Google and notes. In a second attempt, you explain that gravity is proportional to the mass of an object, and we don't actually fully understand where it comes from. Meaning apples are drawn to each other, but since they are small compared to, for example, the earth, you don't actually feel them stick to each other. Gravity pulls on all objects equally hard, meaning a feather and a rock have the same pull from the earth. The reason they fall differently is because of the air. In a vacuum, they actually fall equally fast.

Now you are doing better, but new questions arise:

- What is a vacuum? Do all things really fall equally fast in it?
- How large does something need to be to feel gravity from it?

And so on. Interestingly, the latter of these questions has an answer that will border on biology and chemistry.

My personal workflow when learning is:

1. Formulate what I want to learn
2. Do research
3. Explain to an imaginary person (out loud!)
4. Figure out the holes
5. Research more
6. Go deeper and deeper until I feel satisfied

The thing with this technique is that if you get good enough at systems thinking you will go down seemingly irrelevant rabbit holes. Physics will lead you to ethics, psychology to biology and chemistry to painting. Go down these rabbit holes as far as time permits. Be sure to keep your goal in mind.

## Choose the right content & structure

You can spend your entire life trying to learn to cook if you only read books on painting. The example may sound extreme, but the principle always applies. Choose your content wisely. A great approach is Tim Ferriss's DiSSS Approach which you can read about more in [his free bonus chapters from the 4 Hour Chef](https://tim.blog/the-four-hour-workweek-pdf/). The steps in there are:

1. D - Deconstruct. What are the building blocks of this discipline? For example, words in a language.
2. S - Selection. What building blocks give the best output? For example, 20% of words with which you can have 80% of conversations.
3. S - Sequencing. What is the best order to learn elements? Don't assume the order of existing courses/books is the best one. Ask experts.
4. S - Stakes. See the motivation section. Set up a system that motivates you to keep going and punishes you for not continuing.

He suggests combining this with the CaFE approach:

1. C - Compression. Can the 20% most effective building blocks be represented in a one-pager? A cheat sheet or something you can hang on the fridge, for example.
2. F - Frequency. Schedule in an amount of learning that suits your needs and the discipline. Sometimes 10 minutes a day can do a lot, but for other things, it will not help you that much.
3. E - Encoding. Create mental anchors and tricks that work well for your mind. Things like mnemonics.

## Record your learnings in a reference format

The human mind is usually not very good at being exposed to knowledge once and then perfectly retaining it. Recording it has two benefits:

1. You can refer to it later
2. It forces you to compress and structure

It is very valuable to be able to refer back to what you have learned. Either to solidify your learning by repetition, or by refreshing your learnings a while after you have completed a piece of learning.

Additionally, writing down your learnings in a structured format helps you better understand the things you are learning.

Personally, I enjoy writing down notes in a very terse format. Things that work very well for me are structured notes with bullet points as well as mind-maps. Specifically, using graphics in them is very helpful.

Note that the goal of your notes is to be terse. A big mistake is to write down superfluous information. Your goal is to condense information. I personally find it works well to:

1. Write an article for non-experts (usually on my blog)
2. Make a mind-map that only makes sense to people who have read the initial materials

Make sure to back-up your notes well. I take great pleasure in reading summaries I wrote years ago. I still regularly refer back to my own blog posts on [the history of cholesterol](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/history-of-cholesterol-research/), a [summary of the 4-hour body](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/4-hour-body-summary/) or basic post on the link between [cancer, alcohol and longevity](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/is-alcohol-good-for-you/).

## Getting started

Learning is a complex endeavour, but in my experience, there are two elements in this chapter that are fantastic starting points:

1. Embrace a growth mindset
1. Use the Feynman technique

If you do not start with a growth mindset, you are likely to cause yourself frustration and eventually you will quit. Remember the words of Carol Dweck earlier in the chapter:

> Students with a fixed mindset tend not to handle setbacks well. Because they believe that setbacks call their intelligence into question.

and

> Students with a growth mindset are more likely to respond to initial obstacles by remaining involved.

These attitudes are often deeply ingrained and partly subconscious. It is of the utmost importance that you monitor your self-talk and emotional response to learning experiences. Remind yourself in moments of struggle that this is what is making you grow. Like a weightlifter growing his muscles, your mental struggle is exactly what you need in order to grow.

From a very practical viewpoint, the Feynman approach of explaining what you are learning to a novice is incredibly powerful. In my experience the value comes from three aspects:

- It forces you to structure your thoughts
- It forces you to see the whole picture
- It identifies gaps in your understanding

Anyone who claims their field of study is too complex to explain to a novice either doesn't understand what they are studying or doesn't see the full picture. Remember [Feynman talking about fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1pIYI5JQLE). I found this perspective very confronting since it often means that half of what you claim to understand or have learned is, in fact, incomplete understanding. Once you look past that confronting fact (growth mindset!) you can truly sharpen your learning.

When you are learning something, periodically take some time to explain what you have learned either to a novice or an inanimate object. As I write this there is a [3D printed baby Groot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2014307) sitting in front of me who fulfils the role of student. In the past, I have spent many hours explaining biochemistry to a plant on my desk, or programming principles to a rubber duck. It has been the single most powerful technique in my life to generate a deep understanding.

The general cycle of this technique is:

1. Learn (read, do, watch, etc.)
2. Explain to a novice (or inanimate object)
3. Identify points of incomplete understanding
4. Repeat from the top

Keep this going until you are reasonably certain you fully understand the concept you are trying to learn.

## How I learned to learn

From an intellectual development standpoint, I am very lucky to have grown up in the household that I did. I'm not sure why, but my parents would argue over dinner, car rides and other idle time about the most random things.

I vividly remember my father asking "if glass would have a greater atomic weight, would this glass still stand or would the neck break?" over dinner. To be fair, my parents didn't find an answer and ended up in a very frustrated argument. But regardless of the outcomes of these arguments, I was, from a young age, conditioned into asking questions.

During high school, me and my friend observed that our class was filled with two kinds of students:

- Those who memorised materials and worked hard
- Those who grasped underlying principles and did not work

We called them memorisers and understanders. A side effect of being an understander was that you could often get away with studying very little and still passing. Memorisers, on the other hand, had to brute force knowledge into their minds and spent a lot of time on preparing for tests. Understanders tended to do well in disciplines like math, whereas memorisers scored well on languages.

Since then I've learned to separate memoriser/understander from worker/lazy. The current education system is not geared towards understanders in most regards. It rewards being able to reproduce knowledge rather than understanding principles. That means that understanders in my experience don't feel very engaged in school. At least this was the case for me.

A problem with being an understander is that the world is prone to call people who perform well with little effort 'talented'. Many cultures glorify the talented genius over the hard worker. This implicitly leads parents and teachers to tell children that their abilities are innate. Talent is not something you can develop, so as soon as you are branded as talented your agency as a learner is taken away.

On the one hand, it is nice to be called talented, but it puts constraints on your learning. I was lucky to be exposed to the idea of a growth mindset, through the internet, before leaving high school and it has served me greatly. Since then, I've always assumed everything can be trained unless explicitly proven otherwise.

It led me through great adventures in learning. Especially as a teenager in the Netherlands where downloading copyrighted content was not illegal at the time. I had access to courses on the most random subjects. By the time I was 16 I was following courses in hypnosis, massage, writing and a host of other things. I never intended to become an expert in any, but assuming I could learn something triggered me to seek out seemingly random knowledge.

Only during university did I realise that being an understander type learner was just a mental skill, a piece of software if you will. I started to consciously try to develop my systems thinking and learning techniques.

A great inspiration for me was Scott H Young who did something called the MIT challenge[^See his progress logs [here](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)], where he did the entire 4-year MIT computer science curriculum in 1 year. Scott describes himself as not being exceptionally smart, but very skilled at learning. Seeing him complete something as seemingly impossible as doing an MIT degree 4 times faster than you are supposed to was very inspiring.

Since then I've tried to collect as many learning techniques as possible to find ones that suit my learning style, my favourite of which are discussed in this chapter. I intend to keep learning my entire life. Formal education has been interesting, but I'm strongly against the idea that after finishing your degree you are done and in some way "complete". Learning is a human need and I intend to do it as much as I can.
