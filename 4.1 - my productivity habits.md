# My productivity habits

![Matcha with notebook](./assets/4.1.jpg)

When reading the productivity chapters you may get the impression that I'm an always-on machine of perpetual concentration, motivation and productivity. This is not the case.

My habits and techniques allow me to get things done when I choose to do so. But often enough I choose to instead spend time travelling, gaming and reading. I am certainly not above binging a season of a Netflix series over the weekend (thank you, Marvel).

I know though that I can, within a reasonable margin of error, summon the productivity machine in me, regardless of place and time. The below habits are things that work for me.

## The morning is my time of power

I have noticed I get my best work done while the sun is up. Morning and early afternoon are my best times. I'm very sensitive to light exposure, so on days I want to get things done I:

- Wake up using a wake-up light
- Do basic exercises within 10 minutes of getting up (when brain not yet awake)
- Have a shower (ending in cold)
- Meditate for 10 minutes
- Get dressed
- Have tea

The tea is usually a strong green Kabusecha or Gyokuro taken with a capsule of theanine. Depending on the day, I drink the tea while staring out of the window or behind a computer screen. Having a tea ritual in the morning helps me feel like the day has properly started, the caffeine helps too.

Recently I've started to use bright light exposure in the morning through an obscenely bright LED light bulb (60W, not 60W equivalent) that lights my desk. Basically, it feels like it is a summer morning. It helps me stave off winter slowness.

## Think in blocks of 10 minutes

I've observed in many people that they don't like doing any significant work unless they have at least 30 minutes to an hour to do it. I used to be like that as well and told myself "I can't get in a good flow in a few minutes" and "once I get started I will be annoyed at having to stop".

The reality is that working in small increments is a skill. And, like any skill, you can practice and master it. A few years ago I started to do work in any 10-minute increment in the day, mostly out of sheer necessity[^See [How I Survive Multiple Full Time Engagements](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/how-i-survive-multiple-full-time-engagements/)]. I noticed that within a week of practice it was almost effortless to:

- Work for 10 minutes waiting for a train
- Pick up work I started earlier with nearly no startup time
- Gain hours of productive work this way

Of course, I had to facilitate my focus in odd environments. For me, that meant always carrying headphones to isolate myself from the bustle around me, as well as learning to sit with a decent computer posture on a chair, the ground or even standing.

You don't have to go all out like I did. But changing your perspective to see work in 10-minute increments will make you feel a lot more relaxed. Knowing that you can sneak in work here and there in a way that allows you to get things done, even if you don't have a 2-hour block of free time available, is liberating.

## Set my goals and process in advance

Have you ever sat down to work only to realise that half an hour later you are reading a blog on some random thing that has nothing to do with your task? I certainly have.

My instinctive habit when getting behind my computer used to be:

- Crtl+t, press g, press enter
- Crtl+t, press f, press enter
- Crtl+t, press t, press enter
- Crtl+t, press r, press enter

Crtl+t would open a new tab and due to the browser autocomplete my successive keypresses would within the span of 5 seconds open:

- Gmail
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Reddit

One might argue the first still counts as productive (though by now I hold the view that it is not). I would go through this sequence every time I didn't know what to do next.

Luckily I grew to approach my productivity time in a different way:

1. Decide what I'm working on
2. Set parameters
3. Execute

For example:

- Write a blog post
- No social media, no messaging, 2 hours

If you have been conditioned for years to open time-sucking web pages, consider:

- Chrome Extension [Work Mode - Block all social media](https://chrome.Google.com/webstore/detail/work-mode-block-all-socia/dmijhfnjdfpaanlbahmklnhjkbhegepm)
- [Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com) activity tracker that shows how much time you spend doing what

## Setting a timer for low-impact tasks

An empty inbox is nice. Spending 3 hours on emails is not. For tasks like email, cleaning etc that need to be done but are not life-alteringly important I like setting a timer. I'll decide on how much time I am willing to spend on this and then let the timer run.

Not only does it limit the amount of time I spend on it, but it also means I do these tasks faster. Remember, a task fills up the time allotted to it. So don't allot low impact tasks more time than they need.

## Take naps

When I feel my energy levels are a bit low, I have a nap. Usually, that means setting an alarm for 20-60 minutes in bed with earplugs and an eye mask. Interestingly, I have found that spending an hour napping has never made my day feel an hour shorter. If anything the day seems longer due to my increased energy levels after the nap.

I have heard people say that they tend to wake up groggy from naps. If that is you, a potential solution could be the 'coffee nap'. Which basically means you drink coffee right before your nap (as in within a few minutes). The idea is that you have a nap and wake up once the caffeine kicks in.

## Automate as much as possible

I love automation, every time a new task is automated I feel great satisfaction. My automations range from low-tech stuff to self-coded scripts and devices.

**My favourite household automations**

- Robot vacuum cleaner that runs an hour before I wake up (unless I have guests)
- Dishwasher. I despise doing dishes by hand. It is a waste of energy and an inefficient use of detergent. Not to mention the time you lose doing it
- Kitchen machines. Not strictly automation but rather an augmentation. I love my blender & food processor.

**Tech automations**

- My entire computer backs up to Google Drive (I chose Drive due to its integration with Google Photos)
- At 2PM my Raspberry Pi server (a cheap â‚¬30 computer) downloads my Google Drive to an offline hard drive (so my data is on 3 media in 2 locations, in the server park at Google and on both my Pi and laptop)
- My photos always go to Google Photos where facial recognition compiles per person albums
- My phone sound settings also control power saving settings
    - Loud: overclock processor
    - Silent: regular processor, turn screen black & white, disable mobile internet when the screen is off, disable cell reception when connected to wifi
    - Vibrate: go into potato mode. Airplane mode, underclocked processor, forced Android doze (a built-in app freezer) on all apps
- My phone switches to a red filtered screen (night mode) after 22:00 and shuts off access to social media, email etc through the [Tasker](https://play.Google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) app

**Communication automations**

- Keyboard shortcuts for information I type out often through [aText](http://www.trankynam.com/atext/)
    - Bank accounts, credit card number, business VAT number
    - Email, signature, address
- Schedule calls with [Calendly](https://calendly.com) which costs no time going back and forth
- Multi-people meetups are planned using [Doodle](https://doodle.com/)

**Terminal shortcuts (Geek corner)**

I made an app freezer written in bash. It freezes blacklisted processes using a STOP signal and unfreezes them with a CONT signal when they are in the foreground. You can edit the `blacklist` file and add the names of processes you want to freeze. To use the script:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/actuallymentor/mac-freeze-background
cd mac-freeze-background
bash ./freeze.sh
```

I have a shortcut that opens the current Git repository in the browser:

```shell
# Credit: jasonneylon
function gh() {
  giturl=$(git config --get remote.origin.url)
  if [ "$giturl" == "" ]
    then
     echo "Not a git repository or no remote.origin.url set"
     exit 1;
  fi
 
  giturl=${giturl/git\@github\.com\:/https://github.com/}
  giturl=${giturl/\.git/\/}
  branch="$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)" ||
  branch="(unnamed branch)"     # detached HEAD
  branch=${branch##refs/heads/}
  giturl=$giturl
  open $giturl
}
```

Occasionally my wifi will act up in all sorts of ways and I use this 'nuke the adapter' command. It lacks all finesse and was written in a moment of frustration. It works though.

```shell
alias flush='killall -KILL SystemUIServer; sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; sudo route -n flush; sudo route -n flush; sudo route -n flush; sudo route -n flush; networksetup -setairportpower en0 off; sleep 5; networksetup -setairportpower en0 on;'
```

A lazy way to commit all changes in all files in this repository and push them to Github:

```shell
# Usage: push "Some message"
push() {
    git add *
    git commit -a -m "$1"
    git push
}
```

Simplifying my most commonly used grep command:

```shell
# Usage grab "some words"
grab(){
    grep -ir "$1" .
}
```
