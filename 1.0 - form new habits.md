# Form new habits

![Book and Coffee]( ./assets/1.0.jpg )

Habits are the framework on which your life runs. They are the invisible thread that guides your way. Good habits are superpowers that effortlessly support the part of you that deserves to grow. Rather than let habits form on their own, learning to direct them is a powerful way to shape the person you will become over the coming years. Charting your own course is a challenging but very rewarding practice.

**Principles for forming new habits**

1. Have a clear game plan
1. Set up motivational structures
1. Stack the environment in your favour
1. Have specific triggers
1. Commit for 30-days

## Have a clear game plan

Your plan of action is what will shape your actual behaviour. It is of the utmost importance that your plan makes sense in the following ways:

1. It is clear about what you are going to do
1. The plan is within realistic bounds
1. There are clear triggers

A vague plan like 'I will exercise more' can never succeed because the goal is not defined. A plan like 'I will do 5 push-ups per day' works much better. Ideally, you formulate a trigger as well, like 'I will do 5 push-ups per day right before my daily shower'.

The above plan checks all boxes:

1. The plan (5 push-ups a day) is clear
2. You are capable of 5 push-ups a day (if not, lower the number)
3. There is a clear trigger for your intended habit

Another example may be saving money. The goal 'I want to save more money' could be formulated as 'I will transfer 10% of my paycheck to my savings account the day after I receive my wage'.

## Set up motivational structures

After a clear game plan, you need to make sure that you have the right internal and external pressures to keep you going. For detailed strategies please read the chapter on motivation. The most important elements for habit formation are:

- Writing down the cost of failure
- Writing down the benefit of success
- Set up accountability
- Create a path of least resistance

The motivational elements are as important as setting well-defined goals with well-defined triggers. In particular, closely read the section on accountability, which is for most people the most powerful driver.

## Stack the environment in your favour

Humans are physical creatures. The space around us and the things we are exposed to strongly influence our decisions. Putting yourself in the right physical space and exposing yourself more to the things you want and less to the things you do not want is extremely powerful. Imagine how hard it would be to avoid eating sugar when you are in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Or how much easier it is to have a daily workout if there is a gym within walking distance. Your environment matters.

The idea here is to influence two variables:

- Making sticking to your habit easy and fun
- Making deviating from your habit difficult and painful

Your environment in the very physical sense should be conducive to sticking to your new habit. Consider what you need to institute your new habit and have it around. Similarly, remove things that will tempt you to break your new habit. If you are trying to drink more water, make sure you always have a bottle of water with you. If you are trying to eat less candy, make sure there is no candy in the house.

For many habits it pays off to have cues and reminders. Personally, I find Post-its very helpful. Stick reminders for your new habits in places you see often. I personally favour doors into rooms I am bound to visit multiple times a day like the bathroom/shower. You may opt for very direct triggers. An example of that is hanging a pull-up bar in a doorpost you walk through often. You may also opt for digital cues. I, for example, have a 'go to bed' alarm that rings at night. Likewise, when I open apps on my phone that tend to turn into time-sinks (email, Reddit, Instagram) I get a popup asking 'are you sure you want to spend time and focus on this?' for 5 seconds.

To make sticking to your habit more fun, make sure to have a conducive environment and equipment set. For example, I find stretching far more enjoyable on a high-quality yoga mat, causing me to stretch more consistently. Likewise, if you are trying to cook healthier food, make sure to have tools like good knives to make it easier and more enjoyable. This is not just true for equipment but also for space, time and other environmental variables. If you are trying to take up meditation, for example, it pays off to explore what location in your house/office/school is most silent during the times you like to meditate. I used to use an empty room, where people dumped whiteboards and unused chairs, for my afternoon meditation session at work.

In the same way that you make desirable behaviour easier, you want to introduce pain for undesirable behaviour.

One form of pain is introducing extra effort. You would be surprised at the effectiveness of things like:

- Browser extensions that block social media
- Having the bulk of your money in an account without a card
- Putting the chocolate in a cupboard high enough that you need a chair to reach it

These obstacles are all surmountable. After all, you can disable a browser extension, use your banking app to transfer money to the account that does have a card, or use a chair to reach the chocolate. Funnily enough that extra little effort is often what we humans need to decide it is not worth it.

Another very effective method is committing money to things. Consider two scenarios, one in which you pay for 10 sessions with a personal trainer and one where you pay the trainer after each session. Which of those scenarios do you think would result in more sessions with your personal trainer? You can do this with plenty of new habits. Sink some cost into it combined with the other techniques in this section and you are likely to increase your odds of success. The reason this works is that not sticking to your habit after you have sunk money into it feels like (and is) losing money. If you give a person €10 they will be happy. If you give them €20 and later steal €10 from them they will be sad. Even though in both scenarios they end up with €10[^See Wikipedia entry on [Loss Aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)]. Humans are more risk-averse than goal-oriented, use that to your benefit.

## Have specific triggers

Effective triggers for habit formation come in the form of:

- **Location:** e.g. doing five push-ups when you get home
- **Time:** e.g. going to bed at 22:00
- **Activity:** e.g. read a page of an interesting book when you go to the bathroom
- **Feeling:** e.g. when I feel like smoking I will go for a walk instead

Depending on the habit you are trying to institute you can implement one of multiple triggers of any kind. It is important to make sure that triggers are realistic and that the corresponding habit is easy to execute.

Triggers are most effective when there is an outside force reminding you of them. If you just decide to go to bed at 10 every day, there is a high likelihood that there will be times you will lose track of time and fail to stick to your habit.

Personally, I find the following reminder mechanisms most effective:

- Location-based reminders
- Digital reminders
- Social reminders

Location-based reminders can be the previously discussed Post-its, but also, for example, making sure there are interesting books in your bathroom or having a pull-up bar in one or multiple doorposts.

Digital reminders have many forms. The obvious choice is setting recurring alarms, for example, the bedtime alarm mentioned before. Smartphones can do a lot more though. For example, most Androids and iPhones can give location-based reminders (e.g. a notification when you get home). Likewise, your digital calendar can be used to plan in workouts or even daily meditation sessions.

Social reminders depend on other people. For a while, I combined this with digital reminders to institute a daily meditation practice. I would sit down to meditate at 12:00 every day together with my little brother who was in Australia at the time. We would have a quick exchange through a messaging app beforehand and would ask each other how it went after. Likewise, you can ask a co-worker to remind you to go for a walk at lunch, or have your significant other remind you that you haven't worked out today.

## Commit for 30-days

First off, there is nothing magical about the number 30. It just turns out we are socially conditioned to see 30-days as a standardised amount of time because of our calendar system. 

The power behind this commitment technique starts with the fact that implementing a habit for the rest of your life sounds incredibly significant and difficult. Contrarily, most people are pretty sure they can stick to even difficult new habits for 30-days.

Once something has a clear end date, a 'light at the end of the tunnel' if you will, it becomes easier to stick to it. The key here is that you are allowed to stop the habit after these 30-days. It's kind of like a 30-day free trial on a habit.

The funny thing about doing something for 30-days is that after they are over, many people find out that a habit has now become exactly that, a habit. This means that after the initial 30-days, most people find it trivially easy to keep the habit going.

To make your chances of success higher, you will, of course, have to combine this with the above techniques. But for many people using this technique makes it significantly easier to institute a new habit.

## Getting started

Habit formation is a very powerful skill. To prove to yourself that you are capable of engineering your routines, I suggest starting with a 30-day experiment. To set it up:

1. Pick a clear & measurable goal
1. Pick a measuring device
1. Get others on board

For example, you may resolve to:

1. Do 5 push-ups a day
1. You strike an x on your calendar for every day you complete
1. You convince a sibling/friend/colleague to do the same and you keep track of each other

You may use some of the other measures in this chapter to make success more likely, but when getting started, simplicity makes it more likely you will actually get started.

If you are not sure what habit to start with, here are some of my favourite ones from easy to hard:

- Drink 2 large glasses of water within 10 minutes of getting up
- Meditate for 5 minutes (or more)
- Do x push-ups (5, 10, 20 depending on your fitness)
- Listen to productive podcasts on your way to work
- Don't use screens (TV, phone, computer) in the last hour before sleeping
- End your showers with 1 minute of cold water
- Sleep for 8-9 hours a day
- Eat no added sugar

I'm sure that when you think for a few minutes, you can think of a habit that will make your life significantly better. As you can see above, it doesn't have to be a big or complex habit, start simple.

## More time in a day

I, like many people, used to wish there were more than 24 hours in a day. It lead me to consider things like polyphasic sleep[^This is sleeping in small increments throughout the day rather than one monolithic block at night. You can use it to sleep hours less per day, at least short-term.] to increase my waking hours. After a while, I realised that less time is not all that useful if you don't effectively utilise it. I concluded that there is no difference between an extra hour and increasing the utility of one hour. Similarly a lot of the things I wanted the extra time for were things that really only required proper management of time and discipline.

This caused me to go through a different process, one where I was not trying to optimise the amount of time I had but the quality of usage. There were all sorts of things I wanted to do. Reading more books, listening to podcasts, spending less time on social media and so on. Likewise, there were things about myself I wanted to change, like having high energy levels and a fit body.

Looking at things from a habits perspective was a big shift for me. I had all sorts of activities in the day that when used as a trigger for another behaviour had big impacts. One of those is listening to audiobooks and podcasts while biking to school, university and later to work. In the beginning, this was a difficult ordeal involving (legally) pirated audiobooks, wires and mp3 players without a screen. As the tech progressed this evolved into a simple app on my phone. This one habit singlehandedly shaped the ways in which I think about self-development (thanks, Tony Robbins), business (thanks, Blinkist) and pretty much everything else (thanks, Tim Ferriss & guests).

While I discovered the power of habits relatively early, it has taken me years to institute the ones that work best for me. Much of life is trial and error and for me, that meant trying out habits for a few weeks and then either sticking with them or discarding them. I now actually have a relatively unplanned pattern where I re-do my morning routine every few weeks to modify it with the new things I have found and my needs at the time. The process usually involves writing some things down in a notebook, and then translating that to Post-its that go on my bathroom door or scribbles that I write on my hand as a reminder.

The most extreme usage I have ever made of habits for the sake of productivity is the year that I juggled a full-time job with a full-time masters degree (which insisted on physical presence for all classes). Before starting it I knew it would be the biggest challenge I had taken up to that point with regards to time commitment. The preparation process for that year involved a lot of Post-its, see [this article I wrote about it](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/how-i-survive-multiple-full-time-engagements/). Eventually, the main habits that kept me in business/sane that year were to:

- Treat my body well with exercise and food
- Treat my mind well with sleep and meditation
- Take day/week planning seriously
- Work/study whenever and wherever I have 10+ minutes

In practice, that meant I would get up early and first thing spend half an hour planning the most important things that were on my to-do list that day. If I was staying in Amsterdam that morning I would go to the gym and, if not, then I'd be power walking to the train (while listening to inspiring podcasts). The 10 minutes spent waiting were dedicated to work and study, as were the train and tram rides to my client out of town. The advantage of this taking place in the Netherlands was that the trains were comfortable and usually on time. The train line I took was the same as many politicians take (since it went to The Hague) and I used to joke that the train operator took extra effort to make sure that the trains were never delayed (happened once in the entire year).

The ride to my client was spent prepping for that day's work, whereas the way back consisted of preparing for the class I'd be taking when I got back to Amsterdam. On an average day, I'd absorb the learnings from books through audio summaries, prepare and do work, prepare and participate in class, work out, meditate and cook good food. It was a rollercoaster that I wouldn't choose to repeat any time soon. But like a good rollercoaster, it was exciting and intense. The whole experience illustrated to me how powerful the right habits can be and the things they can facilitate in your life.
