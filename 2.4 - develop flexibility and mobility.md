# Develop flexibility and mobility

![Yoga Pose]( ./assets/2.4.jpg )

Imagine the feeling of taking off a tight and constraining piece of clothing and the freedom that comes with it. For many people, their body is like a constant constraining factor, and because they have never known anything else, they think it's normal. Developing flexibility feels like taking off a suit that has had you constrained for years. The freedom of being able to move your body is a type of freedom most people have never known.

**Principles for flexibility**

1. Choose stretching routines that target many and large muscle groups
1. Treat stretching as an active exercise
1. Treat stretching as normal length workouts
1. Stick with intense stretch workouts for at least 6-12 months
1. Consider Gymnastics Strength Training (GST)

## Flexibility versus mobility

While strength and stamina receive a lot of attention in pop culture, the attribute of mobility is not as prominent.

- Flexibility refers to the ability to stretch into certain positions passively and is mostly a function of muscle and connective tissue flexibility
- Mobility refers to being able to get into a position while maintaining strength and is greatly a function of how far the range of motion in your joints is

They are connected, but not the same. Flexibility tends to be static whereas the goal of mobility is to be able to use the body to move comfortably through physical motions.

An example of flexibility is a pancake motion forward without actively engaging any muscles:

Whereas being able to squat deeply with good form is an example of functional mobility:

In this chapter when the word flexibility is used, please interpret it as meaning mobility. The reason I use the word flexibility in the title of this chapter is that most people would have no idea what the chapter is about if I used the word mobility.

Optimally, the human body should be able to move in any number of ways that are, in our society, anything but standard. Many people are not even able to touch their toes while keeping their legs straight. Being able to make these motions makes the body more injury proof and prevents a host of common problems, like back pain.

## Treat stretching as an active exercise

If you stretch passively, meaning without having your muscles under tension, you are not giving your body the right signals to promote active mobility. We know, for example, that there are studies showing  that stretching before exercise makes you weaker[^See [Reduced strength after passive stretch of the human plantarflexors](https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.2000.89.3.1179) and [Factors Affecting Force Loss With Prolonged Stretching](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/h01-017)] and stretching before running makes you slower[^See [The acute effects of combined static and dynamic stretch protocols on fifty-meter sprint performance in track-and-field athletes](https://search.proquest.com/openview/aaf4551f6258328dd04c1fdb92111a5d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=30912)]. Instead you should be stretching while your muscles are actively under tension. From a performance standpoint we know that active dynamic stretches improve short-term performance and active static stretches do not have a negative impact like passive stretching does[^See [The effect of different warm-up stretch protocols on 20 meter sprint performance in trained rugby union players](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574098)]. Over the long term, stretching actively conditions your body to facilitate active mobility and range of motion, rather than unidimensional passive stretch ability that will not carry over fully into your ability to move well. Passive stretching will still have some benefits, but substituting it for active stretches will result in better results.

One of the keys to the development of functional mobility is practising putting your body in a position while maintaining muscle tension. When doing these exercises we are training the body to do a number of things:

- To neurologically allow muscles to release tension
- To neurologically allow muscles to relax further
- To develop anatomical structures to handle greater ranges of motion

One element of mobility is the ability of your muscle to relax and lengthen. When you think of a tense muscle preventing you from stretching, this is partially not a result of an anatomically stiff muscle. Instead, there is a neurological pressure that is keeping the muscle tense. By stretching we are in essence sending neurological signals to let go of the tension.

Additionally, we are influencing the 'safety switch' on the muscles. You have probably noticed that your muscles reflexively contract when they stretch beyond a certain point. This is the body preventing you from doing permanent damage by moving into positions you can't (yet) handle. By stretching your muscles you are sending a signal that in essence says 'look here body, we can safely go this far, you should set the safety limits a little less strict'.

Lastly, there are a number of slow-developing structures like tendons that impact your ability to stretch and gain mobility, as well as potential muscular adhesions causing tension. These structures are slow to grow and change. While muscles take weeks to develop, these structures take months. Damaging them also means you will take a long time to recover.

Note that the above tells you that you will most likely see some quick initial results, followed by a period of a plateau. The initial muscle relaxation is something you will notice even as you compare the beginning and the end of your workout. The further relaxation of the neurological range of motion will take a bit longer and the development of the tendons longer still. When you reach a plateau, embrace it and keep going. Your body needs these signals over the long term. If you suspect that muscle tension and adhesions are holding you back, consider finding a (painfully) professional massage therapist.

## Target many and large muscle groups

For most people tension is most severe and problematic in larger muscle groups. For example, hamstrings, quadriceps and the lower back. Of course, there are many other problematic areas like the calves and neck.

Often there are exercises that can target large and multiple muscle groups at once. For example, pancake motions when executed correctly can stretch the back, hamstrings and calves. Favour these kinds of exercises over very specific movements.

**My favourite stretches**

I do these stretches every day. They keep my main points of flexibility in shape but must be supplemented with more whole-body stretch workouts. Generally, I dynamically walk through these as a mini warm up and then hold each pose for 10 seconds. I spend extra time on the pancake and straddle stretches since those muscles tend to go tight fast for me.

1. Pancake (leaning forward)
1. Pancake (body flat on leg)
1. Straddle side stretch
1. Achilles stretch (leaning on one foot)
1. Glute stretch
1. Elevated bridge
1. Knees by ears (rolled on your back)

**General advice**

- Stretching should be uncomfortable, but not painful
- Connective tissue grows and heals slowly, give it time
- Injuries of connective tissue take a long time to heal, don't overdo intensity
- Stretching isn't about relaxing, actively engage your muscles
- Any stretching beats no stretching, make it a daily routine

## Treat stretching as normal length workouts

Exercise is something we use to give our bodies a signal for what development we desire. In the case of weight lifting, we are saying 'our muscles are not developed enough for this task, please develop them'. In the case of muscles, the body will activate synthesis pathways for muscle development.

With flexibility and mobility work, we need to give an equally strong signal that we want to develop connective tissue and muscle relaxation. To that effect, we need to take exercising for flexibility as seriously as muscle development.

## Horizon: 6-12 months

Connective tissue develops much slower than muscle, meaning that you will notice that:

- Flexibility develops slowly as connective tissue changes over weeks and months
- Your range of motion often ends up being 'stuck' for a while, and then suddenly develops dramatically seemingly overnight

The upside to this is that once developed it takes a lot less effort to maintain flexibility and mobility.

## Gymnastics Strength Training

Personally, I have had great experiences with the GST approach[^See the [Gymnastic Bodies website](https://www.gymnasticbodies.com/)], specifically the fundamentals 1 series. It takes principles from gymnastics and translates them into gym-friendly workouts that increase your flexibility and mobility hand in hand.

The program is quite intense though and for a good few months had me doing daily workouts. The results are astonishing and I highly recommend this program to anyone who takes developing flexibility and mobility seriously.

If anything, this program is a good way to go from your current level to the level you desire to achieve. I found doing a workout every day unfeasible for me personally, but highly recommend following the program for as long as needed to get to your desired level. After that, you can institute maintenance routines.

Some observations:

- You will need some special equipment (that is available in most gyms or cheap to get)
- Some exercises require things like gymnastics rings. I ended up using whatever was reasonably close to the instruction video that was available in my gym

## Getting started

For most people who read this, flexibility and mobility are most likely at the point where touching the ground without bending your legs is hard or impossible. The question I recommend you pose yourself is:

> How serious are you about your mobility?

In my mind, there are two approaches you can take. The first is intense, difficult and very rewarding within 6 months. It involves following an intense program like Gymnastics Strength Training. I personally took this approach and have made progress that I didn't think possible when I started. While effective, it is not for the faint of heart and requires at least 3 hours a week of exercises.

The second approach is more tempered and mild. It will certainly get you results, but they will be far slower. In this approach, you institute a less intense but consistent stretching practice. You may, for example, set up a daily stretch routine of 10-20 minutes that targets the most commonly tense large muscle groups.

If you take this approach, I have personally found the following stretches most helpful:

- Pancakes (sitting in a straddle and bringing your body down to the floor and your legs)
- Straddle side stretch (tension in these side muscles is the cause of a lot of back problems)
- Glute stretch (especially if you sit a lot)
- Elevated bridge (for the upper back and shoulders)

Set up a consistent routine, for example, a stretching session before bed. I personally enjoy stretching while consuming some entertaining but not too stimulating medium like a podcast (have a look at [Dan Carlin's hardcore history](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)). Remember to do these stretches actively, meaning you don't relax into them but actively use your muscles to pull you into the desired position.

## How I became 'the flexible guy'

Flexibility has never been my strong suit. My friends in high school all assumed I was flexible because I did trampolining, presumably because they thought it was like gymnastics. The reality was though that touching my toes with my legs straight has been hard or impossible for me at different times in my life.

As I started freelancing and developing a professional career I started being plagued by back and neck pain. I later found out back issues are prevalent in both my mother and father's families to different degrees.

I remember one incident where I was sitting against a wall cross-legged when suddenly - boom! - my back exploded in excruciating pain. For a good 3 days walking hurt, getting dressed hurt and pretty much everything other than lying flat hurt (and even that a little).

As any sane person would I visited a physiotherapist specialising in back pain within days of being able to walk again. He looked at me, had me do some postures and proclaimed we'd get things fixed in no time. Two times a week I visited the practice and was guided through a number of exercises.

Most of the exercises though focused on strength and joints:

- Deadlift motions without weight
- Lifting arms and legs on all fours
- Bending the back on all fours
- And so on

While I did start to feel better, I could feel that my back was not doing ok. From the way my muscles felt during the exercises I concluded that my hamstrings and core muscles were very tight.

Of course, I followed the advice of my physiotherapist, but could not resist reading some books on the topic of flexibility, mobility and injury proofing.

Through this search, I found a book called Becoming a Supple Leopard which pulled into question most things I knew about how a body should move. This book told me all the sensible and logical things that no gym coach or therapist had articulated to me. From body posture under stress to flexibility with relaxed muscles being an incomplete approach.

Meanwhile, I started trying all sorts of flexibility approaches, from the things I found in books to daily yoga classes at six in the morning.

I started to put these practices to use, but still nothing really clicked. That is until I found out about Coach Christopher Sommer. A former US national gymnastics coach with strong and unconventional views on what a normal healthy human body should be able to do.

He extrapolated his gymnastics philosophy into a set of workout routines designed to help both couch potatoes and inflexible muscle-heads to develop strong flexibility. Coach Sommer doesn't believe in strength and flexibility being isolated properties of the body. His workouts are designed for what he calls mobility, the application of strength in all relevant angles.

I started his gymnastics strength training series called Foundation and Stretch. These two had me in the gym multiple times a week for a good hour doing all sorts of stretches and strength exercises.

In the beginning, the whole thing was pure torture. Every 45-minute workout made me feel miserable. What kept me going is that after the actual workout, my body felt absolutely wonderful. For the first few weeks, I seemed not to progress at all. Then suddenly one day I was able to touch my toes.

Another few weeks passed without progress. Then seemingly out of the blue, I had no issue whatsoever bringing my face to my knee with a straight leg. Time progressed and before I knew it I had been training for a good 6 months and my body felt like it never had.

After the first few intense months I modified the workout into a short daily session I do to maintain my body's mobility. I have never since had any significant back pain and people compliment me on 'being such a flexible person' and complimenting me on my 'yoga workouts'.
