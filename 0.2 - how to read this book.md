# How to read this book

Treat this book as a buffet. Find the things you like, consume them and skip what doesn't appeal to you. You are welcome to read this book front to back, back to front or in a random order. You may already know some things, and other chapters may open new worlds to you. Take your time and integrate things that appeal to you into your life.

## Sections

The book is separated into 4 sections:

1. Productivity & learning
2. Health & body recomposition
3. Finance & investment
4. My specific implementations of the information in this book

## Structure of the chapters

The chapters in the first 3 sections follow the same format. I am aware that this kind of pre-defined structure does not appeal to everyone. While some people prefer a more story-based approach, I consider this book to be more of a manual than a storybook (though I tell my personal story in isolated sections as well). 

Each chapter is written so as to have a 'how to' approach. Every chapter has 5 sections:

1. The principles in this chapter
2. What you can expect in this chapter
3. Explanation of each principle
4. Getting started suggestions
5. My personal story in learning

## Taking notes

You are most likely reading this on a digital device, presumably an e-reader (Kindle/Kobo etc.) or as a PDF on another device. Both of these options usually have highlighting and bookmarking capabilities. I recommend highlighting things you want to think about more later, and bookmarking pages you want to refer back to at a later point. View [this Kindle help page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201241990), [this Kobo help page](https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/3271/highlighting-text-on-your-kobo-ereader) or [this Adobe reader page](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/mark-text-edits.html) for instructions on how to do that.

This book uses footnotes that look like this[^This is a footnote]. I use these footnotes both for comments and references, which I've been informed is against grammar rules, oh well... These footnotes will render in a smaller text under the paragraph in which they were used.
