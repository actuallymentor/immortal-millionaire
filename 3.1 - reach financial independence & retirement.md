# Reach financial independence / retirement (fi/re)

![Beach from Above]( ./assets/3.1.jpg )

Imagine what you would spend your energy on if you didn't have to work to survive. Imagine what you would try to create or achieve if you had a guaranteed income regardless of what work you choose (not) to do. And then open your mind to the possibility that almost everyone can achieve this with the right knowledge.

**Principles of financial independence**

1. Calculate your desired yearly income
1. Invest 25 times your desired yearly income in low-cost index funds
1. Consider different types of fi/re
1. Track your progress

**In this chapter**

- How to calculate the yearly income you need to survive
- Why it is safe to assume a 4% withdrawal rate on your investments
- Why it doesn't matter how long you will live if you use the 4% rule
- How a billionaire and his special ops friend talked me into investing

## Calculate your desired yearly income

Our goal is to create a perpetual money growing tree so that we can become financially independent / retired, abbreviated as fi/re. This is irrespective of age.

![Money Tree](./assets/commissioned/money-tree.svg)

The goal of your money tree is to generate money for you. There are 3 steps to building your tree:

1. Calculating the size
2. Growing the tree
3. Eating the fruits forever

For most people, retiring on a money tree is feasible, especially if you start early.

There are three money amounts we will calculate that you need in order to reach:

1. Survive - meet your basic needs
2. Thrive - allow you to spend on fun
3. Freedom - let you live your perfect lifestyle

For each of these three, we need to come to a specific number.

**Note:** The below examples are a simplified illustration of the process, they are not meant to be 100% accurate.

### Survival: not having to work

Your basic needs come down to food, shelter and obligations. Calculate your monthly cost and multiply by 12 to calculate what yearly income you need.

Things to keep in mind here:

- Rent
- Food
- Insurance
- Non-optional costs

**Do not include fun** in here. The idea of your survival number is that you will not go into debt if you stop working. The survival level is not about retirement as such, having this amount will grant you certain perks like:

- No stress about not making rent
- Freedom to quit your job be able to take months finding your next one
- All your additional income is now available for fun

Make this category as bare bones as possible.

An example from when I lived in Amsterdam:

| Expense | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl. gas/water/electricity) | 780 |
| Food | 200 [^I prefer 400, but can live on 200] |
| Cellphone plan | 15 [^My current one is higher, but at current rates, this serves my needs] |
| Healthcare insurance | 100 [^Mandatory by law in the Netherlands] |
| **Total** | €1095 |

€1095 times 12 months equals €13,140. This is the after-tax income I need to survive.

### Thriving: include fun

The second amount we calculate will include the spending desires you have. In this level, we include regular stuff you currently do, but not yet your crazy dreams like holiday homes, private islands and space travel.

An example:

| Expense | Average expenditure per month in € |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Massages | 200 |
| Foodie foods | 200 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Better healthcare | 50 [^If you are from the US this sounds strange, but maximum healthcare is about 150-200 in the Netherlands including dental etc.] |
| Optional insurances [^Property, travel, etc] | 50 |
| Travel | 200 [^€2400 a year is worth 5-10 trips within Europe.] |
| **Total** | **735** |

Survival (1095) plus fun (735) equals €1830. This equals a yearly (12 months) amount of €21,960.

Note that this number will vary greatly per person and location. Many big-city Americans will marvel at the low rent/healthcare/food costs while rural Italians will scoff at these exorbitant numbers.

There are no wrong answers. This is about how you personally want to live your life.

### Freedom: the dreams

This category is not about spending as much money as possible but rather about fulfilling your dreams. Note that this might take some research.

Many people think they want to buy a yacht to sail the Mediterranean seas. But in the words of secondhand yacht salespeople: *the only days you will be happy about your yacht is the day you buy it and the day you sell it*. For the vast majority of people, the cost of maintenance, storage etc is a nightmare.

Think instead about how you can have the *experience* you want. For example:

- Buying a yacht is expensive, renting it for a week is cheaper. Are you really going to spend 6 months a year using it?
- Same for private jets. Chartering a jet often beats owning one.
- House on the beach? If you use it only a month a year perhaps budgeting for a high-end Airbnb suits you better.
- And so on.

An example calculation:

| Dream | Yearly cost |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Spending winter in Spain | 6000[^3 months of €2000 gets you a sweet time in Spain. Lower cost places like Thailand will be even more extreme.] |
| More massages | 5200[^100 times 52 weeks] |
| City trip every month | 4500[^500 per trip times 9 months (since we are in Spain in winter)] |
| Fun shopping | 12000[^1000 a month seems good to me, maybe you like it higher or lower] |
| **Total** | **€27,700** |

This (€27,700) adds to the previous survival & fun (€21,960) to: €49,660

## Invest 25 times your desired yearly income

There is a well-established rule in investing that a balanced portfolio can over time safely support a 4% withdrawal rate[^See the 1994 paper [Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data](http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/Bengen1.pdf)]. Note that this section and chapter cover how much to invest but not yet how to invest. The practical details on how to invest are the subject of the 'have your money generate money' chapter.

There are many news outlets that will gladly proclaim that the 4% number is wrong because the study is from 1994 where interest rates were higher. These sensationalist non-experts lack long-term historical perspective. In fact, the original researcher recently crunched the numbers based on recent market data and in his own words:

> The "4% rule" is actually the "4.5% rule"- I modified it some years ago on the basis of new research. The 4.5% is the percentage you could "safely" withdraw from a tax-advantaged portfolio (like an IRA, Roth IRA, or 401(k)) the first year of retirement, with the expectation you would live for 30 years in retirement. After the first year, you "throw away" the 4.5% rule and just increase the dollar amount of your withdrawals each year by the prior year's inflation rate. [^See [this wonderful 'Ask me Anything'](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6vazih/im_bill_bengen_and_i_first_proposed_the_4_safe/) on reddit]

Note for non-US citizens: the IRA/401(k) mentioned above is how the US allows its citizens to invest money for their own pensions. Most other countries do not work like this. In the Netherlands, for example, I can only open a regular investment account and get no tax benefits for saving for retirement.

Note about the 4% versus 4.5%: the 4.5% referenced people who retire at a later age and only need to support themselves from retirement onward. As we'll cover below, the 4% rule should cover infinity based on currently available data.

Of course, there are possibilities that a black swan event occurs and everything we thought we knew about money goes out the window. This chance is however quite low and leaves us with no strategy to plan.

**We will act based on the best information currently available to us.** Which is to assume a 4% withdrawal rate.

Based on the calculations of the previous paragraphs:

| Yearly income | Assumed withdrawal | Needed money tree |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| €13,140 | 4% | €328,500 |
| €21,960 | 4% | €549,000 |
| €49,660 | 4% | €1,241,500 |

A little math trick: to get your money tree size based on 4% take your yearly income and multiply it by 25 (the calculation behind that is 1/.04 = 25).

### Money forever?

But won't your money run out at some point? Not if the 4% rule remains reliable. Take the (simplified) example of wanting a yearly income from investments of €13,140. According to the above technique of multiplying your desired yearly income by 25, we would need to have €328,500 invested. If your money has an average return of 4%, then every year the 'money tree' grows by €328,500 * 4% = €13,140. Which means that when you take €13,140 a year, you are always left with the original €328,500.

But can this really work? Well, **the best information we have says yes**.

As Bill Bengen notes[^His specific comment can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6vazih/im_bill_bengen_and_i_first_proposed_the_4_safe/dlz1l6r/)]:

>  I find that the state of the "economy" had little bearing on safe withdrawal rates. Two things count: if you encounter a major bear market early in retirement, and/or if you experience high inflation during retirement.

In the above comment a 'bear market' means that the stock markets are trending down and thus not performing very well. Inflation basically means that money becomes less valuable in the sense that you can buy fewer things with the same amount of money.

But what about the major financial crashes we've had the past years?

>  So far, I have not seen any indication that the 4.5% rule will be violated. Both the 2000 and 2007 retirees, who experienced big bear markets early in retirement, appear to be doing OK with 4.5%.

His exact words on withdrawals forever:

> If you plan to live forever, 4% should do it.

How do we make sure we get a 4% return while current (2018) interest rates on the average bank account are near or under 1%? We'll get to that in the investing chapter.

If you still have a nagging feeling in your stomach about the feasibility of a 4% yearly return, look at the data we have of the averaged yearly return (inflation adjusted) of the best and worst performing countries from the year 1900 to 2016[^See [Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook 2017](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=B8FDD84D-A4CD-D983-12840F52F61BA0B4) who copied the data from "Triumph of the Optimists" by Dimson, Marsh, Staunton]:

| Country | Average return[^As defined by the arithmetic mean] |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Finland | 9.3% |
| South Africa | 9.3% |
| Japan | 8.7% |
| Portugal | 8.4% |
| US | 8.4% |
| Australia | 8.3% |
| Germany | 8.1% |
| ... | ... |
| Italy | 5.9% |
| Spain | 5.8% |
| France | 5.8% |
| Belgium | 5.3% |
| Austria | 4.8 % |

## Consider different types of fi/re

There are many ways to become financially independent/retired (fi/re). Lean fi/re defined itself as going fi/re with household expenses < $40,000. Fat fi/re want to retire with more than that. It all comes down to what lifestyle you want to live. If you derive joy from living in the woods and fishing, you may choose lean fi/re. If you find happiness in sailing a private yacht and eating in 5-star restaurants, you may be more of a fat fi/re type. The lean fi/re community argues that being able to retire sooner and spending time on things that actually increase happiness is more valuable than taking more time to work towards fat fi/re.

There is a class of people that calculate their financial goals not on where they live now, but on where they could live. For example, living in Thailand is significantly cheaper than living in New York City. I suggest calculating this amount based on where you *currently* live. You can always move.

Finding a low cost of living (CoL) area to fi/re to can shorten your time horizon greatly. If you live in New York City and pay thousands in rent, moving to a smaller town or even a cheap country could mean you can retire in years instead of decades.

Think well and hard about how and where you want to fi/re. It can have a large effect on how you will live a great part of your life.

Some things to keep in mind:

- Most people who fi/re keep working anyway, usually on more fun things
- Moving to a different country is nice, but keep in mind travel costs

If you'd like to engage with online fi/re communities, I suggest looking at the following:

- Lean fi/re subreddit: [r/lean fi/re/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lean fi/re/)
- Fat fi/re subreddit: [r/fatFIRE/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/)
- Financial independence subreddit: [r/financialindependence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/)

## Track your progress

Long-term goals are notoriously hard to work towards. One element that makes long-term goals so tricky is that you often only see their result far in the future. In the case of working towards financial independence, there are some helpful ways to track your progress.

The first is that once you have calculated the amount of money you need, you can track your progress towards your goal. Depending on how you like to keep track of things this can be done in a spreadsheet or just on a whiteboard. One creative approach I found online was an individual who every month drew their progress on a fridge whiteboard. Personally, I like keeping track through my budgeting software which draws pretty graphs.

Another good motivational calculation is figuring out how much income you can currently generate. If you look at your investment portfolio, the current total divided by 300 is the current monthly income it can support. In other words:

- Every €300 you invest can support €1 of monthly income
- For example, €150,000 invested can support €500/month of income

The math behind this is that based on the 4% rule, your yearly income is equal to 0.04 (which is 4%) times your invested money. Multiplying something by 0.04 is the same as dividing it by 25 (because math). By extension, your monthly income is your nest egg divided by 25 and then divided by 12 to make it monthly instead of yearly. Dividing something by 25 and then by 12 is the same as dividing it by 300 in one go.

## Getting started

The questions you are going to be asking yourself are going to be big and life-changing. The process is not complicated as such, but it will require you to take a detailed look at your financial life. The steps you will go through are those mentioned in this chapter.

Begin by calculating your monthly income needs. Give a good amount of thought to the kind of life you are currently living and how you ideally want to live. Ask yourself if you would be living where you are right now if it were not for work. Likewise, you may come to the conclusion that you will spend less money on food since you might eat out less if you had time to cook. Dive into the different fi/re approaches and based on that make a conscious decision on your goals. Once you have done that, start calculating:

1. Calculate how much you need to survive (food, shelter, mandatory costs)
2. Calculate how much you need to thrive (all the above + fun)
3. Calculate how much you need for full financial freedom (all of the above + dreams)

Convert the monthly needs to yearly (multiply by 12) for easier calculations in the next step. This will leave you with three numbers. For example, €13,140 (survival), €21,960 (thrive) and €49,660 (freedom). These are made up numbers based on my calculations in this chapter, your numbers will most likely be different.

After this, we can calculate how much money we need to have responsibly invested to have this income indefinitely. To do this, we multiply the three numbers by 25. This transforms our income goals into the amount of money we need in our investment portfolio based on a 4% safe withdrawal rate:

- €13,140 x 25 = €328,500
- €21,960 x 25 = €549,000
- €49,660 x 25 = €1,241,500

Knowing these numbers gives you clear targets. Once you reach the first, you may decide to quit your job and pursue another passion. The nice thing is that if your survival needs are taken care off, you can live quite a lavish lifestyle even if you make minimum wage.

How to actually invest the money is something we will cover in the following chapters. Before going through these give some thought to how you want to track your progress. Some people don't really track their progress and just keep in mind their number. This is fine in theory, but if you like the motivation of a concrete graph type progress bar, I suggest thinking of a visual way to go about it. A close friend of mind would undoubtedly recommend getting something called a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com) where you can go nuts on pretty looking graphs.

## How I discovered never working again is an option

When I was a little boy, I once asked my mother how much money a person needs to never have to work again. We were driving in my hometown at the time so she was focussed on the road. She casually said that she thought she could live a comfortable life on a million guilders (the currency we had before the euro).

At the time I had no conception of how the monetary system works. I had heard banking commercials proclaim "geld moet rollen" (money must roll) and "in het verleden behaalde resultaten bieden geen garantie voor de toekomst" (past results do not guarantee future prospects). As for what they meant, that would take me another decade or two.

The first time I was really confronted with a big savings goal was when I decided I wanted to go to China after high school, to do kung fu in the mountains for a couple of months. My parents supported the idea and promised to finance a part of the trip. It left me to save about two thousand euros in a year. It seemed like an infinite amount of money at the time. I worked as a gymnastics teacher after school and often cleaned houses after those training sessions.

Working hard for the money I needed for my trip gave me the feeling of ownership and pride. It also made me forsake a lot of things I would have bought with the money I made if I would have had no goal. The insurmountable goal of an infinite amount of money (two thousand) started to actually feel within my grasp.

The lessons learned in high school carried over to my university years. I always kept a budget and most of the time knew exactly how much money I would have left at the end of the month. Then in rapid succession, I learned about growing money from some unlikely sources:

- A bitcoin loving billionaire with a penchant of wearing superhero ties (hello Tim)
- A special ops/heart surgeon speech
- A man drawing graphs on a wall

All of them happened when I was attending a programme called Draper University in 2013. I had met the program founder, Tim Draper, in New York earlier that year. I had no idea who he was at the time. We were having a conversation sitting around a table about the future of 3D printing and what you could do with it. Tim (tall man, superhero tie, big grin) went on to suggest that personalised sex toys would be a terrific idea. He later proceeded to tell some of us at the table to apply for his summer program.

Only later did I learn that this particular Tim was one of the founders of the venture capital firm DFJ. As the son of the first venture capitalist, he was a bit of a legend in Silicon Valley. I just knew him as the sex toy guy in my head. When I entered the DU summer program, I learned Tim was acquainted with the founder of Jimmyjane, a high-end sex toy producer. Suddenly his suggestion made a lot more sense.

While Tim didn't give us investment advice per se, he was a big fan of bitcoin. At the time it was worth about $80 per BTC. At the time of writing this, it is more like $8000, though it may spike up or downward anytime. His enthusiasm triggered my curiosity and the following months were a bitcoin rollercoaster for me. In the bitcoin world, I learned the meaning of:

- Initial Public Offerings or IPOs (a platform called Havelock investments was hosting a bitcoin company only stock market)
- Buy low, sell high as a principle (and failing at implementing it)
- The pain of losing 60% of your wealth within 24 hours
- The value of hodling (not a misspelling)

The months after my DU experience I poured all the money I could into bitcoin. I was riding the wave of crypto hype. I started buying bitcoin at a price of $100 and kept on accumulating until the peak that year of over $1000. Meanwhile, those bitcoins were invested in companies that promised ever more bitcoins. Mining companies, bitcoin banks, hardware manufacturers, you name it. I learned to read IPO prospectus papers, valuation graphs, candlesticks and so on. My experience went like this:

- Month 1: buying stocks
- Month 2: OMG I have doubled my money!
- Month 3: I am a professional now, I do IPOs and stuff
- Month 4: I can never lose
- Month 5: Where is all my money?!

You see, I went through a full market cycle and education within the span of a year. The beginning months were a total party. It is what wall street traders in a bull market must feel like. Every stock you pick wins (yay look at how smart you are) and your money grows every single day. Sushi ordered using bitcoin became very commonplace. My study debt was as good as paid off in my mind.

Then the bubble burst. The mining company I invested in bought old hardware causing the stock to crash, the value of bitcoin dropped, controversy ensued worldwide due to money laundering allegations, etc.

The year after was spent coming to terms with the emotional aspect of investments. I came out on the other side with some solid principles:

- Only invest if you can handle 50%+ fluctuations in price
- If you feel FOMO (fear of missing out), tread extra carefully
- If you make a decision, only act on it when you've slept on it

A number of 'basic' principles I later learned were common advice in the regular stock market:

- Buy low, sell high. When the market is exuberant sell, buy in times of crisis
- Buy things you believe in and hold them (related to the value investing approach of Warren Buffet)

When all these lessons settled in, the final thing I did before deciding to not track the bitcoin world daily was to invest in a group of people who promised a thing called Ethereum. A few years of patience was rewarded with a triple-digit return on investment factor.

Throughout my bitcoin days, I failed to reflect on two other pieces of advice I got while in the US. They were very similar suggestions from a guy who everyone called 'doc' and the financial planner of Tim Draper. In short, they said to:

- Start investing early
- Invest in index funds

They both did it in their own way, but the message was clear. Don't get burned by waiting to invest, or by trading individual stocks. When looking at large markets they seem to go up and down all the time, but when you zoom out they are trending upward. So don't worry about weekly fluctuations. Invest now and ride the years-long wave of developing markets.

A few years later I read a book called "Money: Master the Game" by Tony Robbins. The book drove home the lessons I had been presented. Within a few days I had:

- Calculated the money I needed to retire
- Opened an investment account
- Set up automated monthly payments to said account

I have since read more and more about investing on a long time horizon, and can only conclude that consistent periodic investment in world index funds is the way to go for the vast majority of people.

I know my own nature though, and protect my long-term financial health by having a smaller amount of money set aside for risky investments I do for fun.
